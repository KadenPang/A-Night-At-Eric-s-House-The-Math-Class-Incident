# A Night At Eric's House: The Math Class Incident
A Night At Eric's House: The Math Class Incident or TMCI is an educational game intended to give high school students more practice with logarithms. 

## Features
The character the user plays as, Jambo, can traverse the map using four directional movement. There are characters scattered throughout Eric's house that can be interacted with using the space bar. Some characters (namely Eric, Mr. Dawson and Bowser) ask questions that must be answered correctly to pass to the next room. Jambo starts the game with 3 health points, a wrong answer will lose 1 health point (the characters endorse physical 'corrections') and in a number of rooms are health kits which, when consumed through the inventory, restore 1 health point. Losing all health points will result in Jambo's demise and a lose screen will be prompted, conversely, moving past the final room means Jambo has escaped and a win screen will be prompted.
